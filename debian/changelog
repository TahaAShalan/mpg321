mpg321 (0.2.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "Not quite 0.3.0 but damn it, Debian is releasing soon" release.
  * Integrate patch from Luc Saillard starting the work on enabling Shoutcast
    streams. We now recognise shoutcast streams!  Closes: Bug#116385
  * Make reading MPEG data from a file descriptor work properly now.
    We weren't preserving the incomplete frame that MAD passed back to us,
    and this caused seams. This fixes the problems people were having with
    gtoaster. Closes: Bug#123537, Bug#124358
  * Fix EOF-detection on file descriptor streams. Closes: Bug#124360
  * Remove the setvbuf test from configure.ac. This was causing cross-compile
    failures.
  * Add special-case for directory prepending code on playlists to properly
    handle URLs in playlists.
  * Add the long-awaited ID3 code, written graciously by Giuseppe Corbelli
    <cowo@lugbs.linux.it>. Everybody thank him right now! :)
  * Add support for alsa09 libao device, and also slightly generalize output
    device code to allow users to specify unknown devices.
  * Fix segfaults in http, ftp, and files - possible security risk.
    Closes: Bug#134751
  * http requests now follow redirects.

 -- Joe Drew <drew@debian.org>  Sun, 10 Mar 2002 19:38:02 -0500

mpg321 (0.2.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed ao.m4. It makes it more difficult to do aclocal on non-debian
    systems, but that's why I ship aclocal.m4.
  * Remove check for libintl.h in configure.ac; remove ifdef on libintl.h
    in getopt.c. Was causing build failures on systems which didn't have
    gettext integrated into the C library (i.e., anything but Linux)
  * Added check for *env; in ao.c, use putenv by default, unless it doesn't
    exist, in which case we use setenv, if it exists. If none of these exist
    we just don't try to use them.
  * Added support for forced stereo output, --stereo. Closes: Bug#119660.
  * Fixed non-printing of @ status in remote control mode in certain
    situations.
  * Fixed segfault when using test mode. Note that libao prints an ugly
    debugging message when test mode is being used, but that's already
    been fixed upstream. Closes: Bug#119523.
  * Made all mp3s play to their actual end, even if we don't print status
    information for that tail end. Closes: Bug#119661.
  * Recompile with new libmad, which has good shlibs. Closes: Bug#118009.
  * Switch back to automake 1.4, the Sane Choice.
  * Update build dependencies for libmad0-dev.
  * Apply patch from Martijn Vernooij to implement line buffering in
    Remote Control mode. This means that you no longer have to wait for
    a reply to your command to enter another.
  * Various correctness fixes wrt mpg123 emulation.
  * Fix segfault when running a playlist with zero files in random mode 

 -- Joe Drew <drew@debian.org>  Mon, 26 Nov 2001 22:45:33 -0500

mpg321 (0.2.2.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Recompile against new libmad packages. (Yes, again.)
  * Update Build-Depends for new libmad packages, and modify them for
    new libao requirements (forgot this earlier).

 -- Joe Drew <drew@debian.org>  Mon, 22 Oct 2001 13:49:27 -0400

mpg321 (0.2.2.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Recompile against new libmad. Grr, broke binary compatibility.

 -- Joe Drew <drew@debian.org>  Fri, 19 Oct 2001 17:13:45 -0400

mpg321 (0.2.2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modify postinst to check for -e mpg123 (file exists) instead of
    -L file (file exists and is a link). This didn't happen on stock Debian
    systems, but if you manually installed mpg123 this is an issue. 
    Closes: Bug#116109

 -- Joe Drew <drew@debian.org>  Thu, 18 Oct 2001 19:03:12 -0400

mpg321 (0.2.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed mono output. Brown paper bag bug, indeed.

 -- Joe Drew <drew@debian.org>  Sat, 13 Oct 2001 21:22:17 -0400

mpg321 (0.2.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Made output when files with no path in the filename were printed
    conform to mpg123 (print a newline after mpg123 blurb)
    (Closes: Bug#114136)
  * Made remote control (-R) print only the filename, minus the extension
    (if one exists), as documented
  * Made mpg321 continue if there was a playlist specified but no
    files on the command-line (Closes: Bug#113294)
  * Concatenated the directory specified for the playlist with the files
    within the playlist itself, as long as the file wasn't specified with
    an absolute path
  * Added and changed header inclusion for BSDs - Patch by Christian Weisgerber
  * Changed calc_length to use unbuffered I/O only; buffered/unbuffered mix
    is undefined on some libcs - Patch by Christian Weisgerber
  * Initialized remote control file in playlist structure on creation -
    caused a segfault on FreeBSD/Alpha. Thanks for all of these, Christian!
  * Changed the string "single-channel" to "mono" in regular output, to
    conform with mpg123.
  * Rewrote README file
  * Added --skip-printing-frames= option, to limit output verbosity
  * Made playing multiple files with different numbers of channels or
    play rates work properly
  * Now using a new, experimental, extremely high quality dithering routine
    from the ever-brilliant Rob Leslie. Sound quality from mpg321 has
    never been better.

 -- Joe Drew <drew@debian.org>  Sat, 13 Oct 2001 02:29:25 -0400

mpg321 (0.2.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * modified to compile and use libao2 by Stan Seibert and Eduard Bloch.
    Closes: Bug#109078
  * implemented CDR, AU and ARTS output support, noted in the manpage.
    Also by Stan Seibert and Eduward Bloch. I'm very impressed!
  * Added compile-time default audio device setting (--with-default-audio=)
  * Added aRts support
  * Enhanced run-time audio device to allow mpg321 to switch easily between
    esd, aRts, oss, alsa, and sun-style audio output
  * made -o h, -o l, -o s no-ops again, rather than emitting error messages.
  * Fixed volume not getting adjusted on mono streams
  * Made usage come up if you use options but specify no files/streams
  * Made mpg321 stop immediately if it can't open a file, like mpg123
  * Made Directory: only show for files which have a path in the filename.
  * Renamed short equiv for --aggressive to -I (Closes: Bug#112451)
  * Eduard Bloch implemented --aggressive - Thanks, Eduard!
  * Added support for playlists to use stdin (-@ -) (Closes: Bug#111499)
  * Made mpg321 compile cleanly with -Wall
  * Added -R (remote control) support. This took a lot of effort - it had
    better work. Please test with frontends and report bugs!
    Closes: Bug#92811

 -- Joe Drew <drew@debian.org>  Sun, 23 Sep 2001 02:42:43 -0400

mpg321 (0.1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated Debian description (Thanks, Joshua)
  * Added configure flag (--enable-mpg123-symlink) to stop creation of mpg123
    symlink on install
  * Added uninstall-hook to warn user about mpg123 symlink on make uninstall;
    it doesn't appear to get run, however. Help!
  * Disable creation of mpg123 -> mpg321 symlink in debian package
  * Re-create /usr/bin/mpg123 -> /etc/alternatives/mpg123 symlink if it
    doesn't exist on install on debian systems.

 -- Joe Drew <drew@debian.org>  Sun, 12 Aug 2001 13:27:37 -0400

mpg321 (0.1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated the install hook which installs a symlink to mpg123 from mpg321
    to work properly. This only affects non-Debian systems, compiling from
    source.
  * Updated libao detection m4 macro. This provides better support for
    platforms like freebsd which require no dl library to dlopen().
    Also updated makefiles, etc, to distribute new m4 directory.

 -- Joe Drew <drew@debian.org>  Thu,  9 Aug 2001 23:36:45 -0400

mpg321 (0.1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed wav file creation. The question isn't why didn't it work now, but
    why did it ever work... Closes: #107014

 -- Joe Drew <drew@debian.org>  Wed,  8 Aug 2001 20:44:05 -0400

mpg321 (0.1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Correct ^C multiple times always killing mpg321
  * Corrected non-casting of random() which made all random playing
    and shuffling not shuffled or random at all
  * Made exiting by ^C-ing multiple times print file stats, etc, rather than
    just exit(0)'ing
  * Removed signal handler for TERM (mpg123-oss doesn't handle TERM, so we
    shouldn't either)
  * Updated short description (not smpeg any more) 

 -- Joe Drew <drew@debian.org>  Sat, 21 Jul 2001 17:04:19 -0400

mpg321 (0.1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add check for null string when setting up alsa driver (why did I
    forget the alsa driver? I did it for every other one...)
    Closes: Bug#105618 

 -- Joe Drew <drew@debian.org>  Tue, 17 Jul 2001 22:22:05 -0400

mpg321 (0.1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Major refactoring of code
  * Inclusion of -@, -Z and -z options
    (playlists, random play, and shuffle play) (Closes: Bug#95861)
    Thanks to Tobias Bengtsson for creating the first version of playlist
    support for mpg321.
  * Added creation of symlink to mpg123 on install (non-debian systems;
    debian uses alternatives). This won't overwrite an existing file 'mpg123'
    in your binary directory, though.
  * Ported to libmad; mpg321 also now uses libao exclusively for output.
    You can use -o alsa or -o esd to specify a different type of output
    device in addition to the -a to specify the specific device.
    Closes: Bug#94290, Bug#98772
  * This release is no longer dependent on libsdl. People who installed sdl
    because of the dependency, please see the package deborphan.
  * Added proper alternative to mp3-decoder.

 -- Joe Drew <drew@debian.org>  Sun, 15 Jul 2001 18:08:23 -0400

mpg321 (0.0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * It's official: network access doesn't work correctly. Oh well.
  * Fixed silliness with setting audio device (artifact from getopt
    translation) Closes: Bug#96398
  * Updated build-depends, configure, etc, for libsdl1.2
  * The next version of mpg321 is likely to be a very large rework so that
    I can slot in libmad, and insert playlist support and other important
    things. (I'll do it soon, I swear!)

 -- Joe Drew <drew@debian.org>  Sat,  5 May 2001 12:54:25 -0400

mpg321 (0.0.5.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Updated man page, usage output because -h is not a valid "help" string,
    even in mpg123 (Closes: Bug#90020)
  * Added Provides: mp3-decoder 

 -- Joe Drew <drew@debian.org>  Sat, 17 Mar 2001 21:13:12 -0500

mpg321 (0.0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Implemented SIGTERM handling (Closes: Bug#85316)
    If anyone has trouble with any other frontends, let me know. I am going
    to start filing 'move-from-contrib-to-main' bug reports.
  * Changed maintainer address
  * Implemented DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS, upgraded to policy 3.5.2
  * Updated description
  * Updated manual page
  * Fixed printing total time instead of time played when interrupting a
    song 

 -- Joe Drew <drew@debian.org>  Sat, 17 Mar 2001 03:05:03 -0500

mpg321 (0.0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Created README.debian telling about alternatives
  * Fixed stupid source and binary-incompatible libao problem (gah. soname
    didn't change, yet api did?)
  * Fixed dumb no-ops with arguments that I missed
  * Made mpg321 depend on SDL 1.1.8 at least, in order to remove the hackish
    way of supporting devfs
  * Ensured documentation for all currently implemented commands
  * Define _GNU_SOURCE. mpg321 will have to be ported to other libc's that
    don't support the GNU extensions, I'm afraid (asprintf, getopt_long)
  * Implemented getopt option handling (Closes: Bug#85321)
  * Added smpeg patch to tarball, until Sam gets un-busy with Tribes 2 and
    releases a new version of smpeg with it integrated
  * Implemented SIGINT handling (Closes: Bug#85320)
    May also fix 85316, but I want to make sure on that.
  * Fixed mpg123 boilerplate to print only once a session
  * Added mpg123 slave alternative for manpage (Closes: Bug#89153)
    Arthur, if you haven't already, please file similar bugs on mpg123, etc.
  * Removed extraneous dh_testversion and other debhelper commands we don't
    need
  * This release has been used with gtoaster to burn audio cds. It seems all
    is well! 

 -- Joe Drew <drew@debian.org>  Fri, 16 Mar 2001 14:09:49 -0500

mpg321 (0.0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add silence to stdout-output (remove garbage in buffer)
  * Fix some free()ing of buffers/etc
  * Update installation instructions WRT dependencies
  * Fix no-op instructions which take parameters
  * Implemented -q (Closes: Bug#85317) 

 -- Joe Drew <drew@debian.org>  Fri,  9 Feb 2001 23:00:39 -0500

mpg321 (0.0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add Provides: mpg123
  * Minor front-end tuning
  * Fixed wav decoding bug - mpg321 is now usable for general purposes!
  * Removed man page generation from debian build process and put in general
    package
  * Uploaded to unstable (Closes: Bug#84772) 

 -- Joe Drew <drew@debian.org>  Mon,  5 Feb 2001 23:32:27 -0500

mpg321 (0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release.
  * This installs alternatives for mpg123 of *greater* *priority* than
    mpg123 itself. This could result in bad audio: DON'T install this package
    for regular use yet if you use mpg123 for mp3 conversion to wav!
